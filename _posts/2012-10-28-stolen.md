So I think I've successfully stolen BuildStarted.com's website for my own, and can now begin converting my content before implementing my own design :)

``` csharp
[CompilerGenerated]
private sealed class c__DisplayClass2
{
  public int i;

  public void b__0()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(this.i);
  }
}
```
